1)when you browse path it cant have to be in a directory that your photos are one directory down.
if i would like to check the photos in 1 folder i would check the data path according to the next path: C:\Users\User\Desktop\roey stuff\python3\nural networkds\data\1
2) the net itself is too big to upload. so i have it on my computer and drive
